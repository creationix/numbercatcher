### Guideline:

On the first occurrence of unacceptable behavior, determine the circumstances involved, resolve the problem, and document the event in the meeting minutes.

On a second occurrence, notify the instructor of the problem. A meeting will be set up to evaluate the situation and resolve the problem.

On a third occurrence, again notify the instructor of the problem. A meeting will be set up to evaluate the situation and resolve the problem. At this point, the team will have the *option* of removing the team member. If removed, then the team member receives a pro-rated grade based on the number of weeks they have participated in the group.

Examples of unacceptable behavior may include not delivering on time, delivering poor quality work, missing team meetings, being unprepared for team meetings, disrespectful or rude behavior, etc. Reasons such as "too busy" or "I forgot", or "my dog ate my design model" are unacceptable.

Valid reasons that must be considered include those listed for obtaining an incomplete standing in a course (illness, death in the family, travel for business or academic reasons, etc.)
