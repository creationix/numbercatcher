Feature: Auto reserve a critical number
  In order to reserve a critical number
  As a user
  I want to make a request for that critical number

  Scenario: Critical number is available
    Given I have logged in as a user
    And I am on Number Set Details page
    And a critical 'number' is available
    And I fill in 'number' for 'number'
    When I press 'Auto Reserve'    
    Then I should see a notice saying 'Number is reserved successfully'
    And a new critical number appears on number list

  Scenario: Critical number is not available
    Given I have logged in as a user
    And I am on Number Set Details page
    And a critical 'number' is not available
    And I fill in 'number' for 'number'
    When I press 'Auto Reserve'    
    Then I should see a notice saying 'Number is not available. Next available number is reserved'
    And a new critical number appears on number list
